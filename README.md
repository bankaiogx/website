## Overview
GYMXP is a gamified fitness platform designed as a user-centered web application. It transforms traditional workouts into an engaging, interactive experience using XP progression, AI-powered virtual trainers, aura effects, achievements, and motivational behaviour-design principles.

The project demonstrates strong UX/UI decision-making, accessibility-focused design, optimised front-end performance, and a structured development workflow. By merging fitness with game-style progression systems, GYMXP aims to increase user motivation, consistency, and long-term engagement through clear goals, instant feedback, and visual reward mechanics.

Inspired by successful behaviour-driven apps like Duolingo, GYMXP targets a niche gap in the fitness market by combining gamification, AI, and gym-based training in a modern, aesthetically focused interface. The website showcases the app concept through cinematic visuals, interactive avatars, and clear feature explanations—providing users with a compelling preview of the full GYMXP experience.
## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to clearly introduce the concept of GYMXP in a way that is simple, visual and easy for users to understand. The site acts as a gateway to information that showcases the key features of the convept, such as XP progression, the AI trainers (which are the key USP), and the overall design and theme of the app. Each page has been designed to visually engage visitors in a style similar to how professional companies and studios present their concepts. The images, videos and text have been arranged in a way that is easy for users to follow and understand without overwhelming them with too much information at once.

From a development perspective, the website is designed to demonstrate my ability to build a responsive, accessible and user‑centred front‑end project. It highlights the use of clean HTML structure, optimised images for efficient performance, Bootstrap for layout, and a consistent visual UI that fits the vision of the project while meeting best practices and accessibility standards. The main purpose of this project, within the scope of development, is to showcase my ability to design and implement a fully responsive interface using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
## Target Audience
The target audience for this website are users who are interested in fitness, self‑improvement and gamified experiences. The typical age range for this demographic is between 15–35. The GYMXP website is mainly aimed at people who struggle with motivation, enjoy strong visuals and visual progress, and prefer more interactive and rewarding modes of training. This includes beginners who want structure, guidance and discipline, as well as more experienced gym users who want to track their progress in a more engaging way than traditional fitness apps currently offer.

The project is also aimed at users who respond well to visual stimuli and character driven design. The three core AI coaches—Blaze, Zaya and Shadow appeal to users who enjoy personality, narrative and digital guidance. The XP system further supports this by mirroring the type of progress users are familiar with from gaming environments. The website presents all of this information in a clear, fun and visually engaging way, with the aim of encouraging users to join the ‘Waiting List’ for early access.

Additionally, the website helps communicate the GYMXP concept to stakeholders and potential developers by clearly presenting the visuals, layout and key features of the idea.
